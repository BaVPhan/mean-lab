# ME(A)N Lab

## Prompt

This is an open-ended group lab! It is up to you and your teammates to come up with a project idea. It must, however, fulfill the following technical requirements...

## Technical Requirements

Your application must be ME(A)N. This includes...
* Using **Express** to handle HTTP requests and serve API endpoints.
* Using **MongoDB** has your database.
* Using **Mongoose** as your ORM.

Your app must use two models, one of which must be nested within the other.  

Your app must be deployed to Heroku.

### Bonus I

Add Angular to your application stack. Express should only handle your root view as well as your API routes. Angular should take care of the rest via `ui.router`.

### Bonus II

Allow the user to log-in using Twitter.

### Bonus III

Allow the user to log-in using a third-party service other than Twitter (e.g., Facebook, Spotify).

## Groups

You will be working in groups of **at most** 4 students. We will leave the group selection up to you. Feel free to do so after the lab has been introduced.

## Lab Submission

Please submit an issue to this repo by Thursday, April 14th at 5PM with...
* A link to your lab repo.
* A link to your deployed application.
* Any questions you would like answered by the instructor grading the lab.
