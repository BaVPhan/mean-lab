# ME(A)N Lab

## Prompt

This is an open-ended group lab! It is up to you and your teammates to come up with a project idea. It must, however, fulfill the following technical requirements...

## Technical Requirements

Your application must be ME(A)N. This includes...
* Using **Express** to handle HTTP requests and serve API endpoints.
* Using **MongoDB** has your database.
* Using **Mongoose** as your ORM.
* Add **Angular** to your application stack. Express should only handle your root view as well as your API routes. Angular should take care of the rest via `ui.router`.

Your app should have CRUD functionality for at least one model.

Aim to deploy your app to Heroku.

### Bonus I

Add a second model to your application, which is nested under the first.

## Pairs

You will be working in pairs. We will leave the group selection up to you. Feel free find a partner, after the lab has been introduced.

### Some ideas

- A Stack Overflow-style question/answer page
- Recipe / ingredients manager
- Competitive Cookie Clicker
- Image tagger

## Lab Submission

Please submit an issue to this repo by the time indicated on the course schedule with the following:
* A link to your lab repo.
* A link to your deployed application (if you have one)
* The names of your group members

## Keep In Mind

KISS (Keep It Simple, Silly), and don't re-invent the wheel!

You may have noticed by now that many of the apps we make in this class are very similar. Some have Artists and Songs, others have Posts and Comments, but they're more-or-less the same concept.

This isn't a WDI thing: it's a real-life thing! A tremendous number of apps follow the same structure.

If you keep this in mind it greatly simplifies the process of making something. You can take any of the walkthroughs and examples provided to you in class and turn them into something that *looks* completely different. A Honda and a Porsche are both pretty much the same thing inside.

The app you make today probably will not be the magnum opus that defines you as a developer for the rest of your life, so don't put that pressure on yourself. Be silly, and have fun!
