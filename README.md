# ME(A)N Lab

## Prompt

This is an open-ended group lab! It is up to you and your teammates to come up with a project idea. It must, however, fulfill the following technical requirements...

## Technical Requirements

Your application must be ME(A)N. This includes...
* Using **Express** to handle HTTP requests and serve API endpoints.
* Using **MongoDB** has your database.
* Using **Mongoose** as your ORM.

Your app must use two models, one of which must be nested within the other.  

Your app must be deployed to Heroku.

### Bonus I

Add Angular to your application stack. Express should only handle your root view as well as your API routes. Angular should take care of the rest via `ui.router`.

### Bonus II

Allow the user to log-in using Twitter.

### Bonus III

Allow the user to log-in using a third-party service other than Twitter (e.g., Facebook, Spotify).

## Groups

You will be working groups of 3 for this lab. Groups will be determined by counting off students during the lab intro. If you are in Classroom 4, count off from 1-6. If in Classroom 6, 1-8.

## Keep In Mind

KISS (Keep It Simple, Silly), and don't re-invent the wheel!

You may have noticed by now that many of the apps we make in this class are very similar. Some have Artists and Songs, others have Posts and Comments, but they're more-or-less the same concept.

This isn't a WDI thing: it's a real-life thing! A tremendous number of apps follow the same structure.

If you keep this in mind it greatly simplifies the process of making something. You can take any of the walkthroughs and examples provided to you in class and turn them into something that *looks* completely different. A Honda and a Porsche are both pretty much the same thing inside.

The app you make today probably will not be the magnum opus that defines you as a developer for the rest of your life, so don't put that pressure on yourself. Be silly, and have fun!

## Lab Submission

Please submit an issue to this repo by Thursday, April 14th at 5PM with...
* A link to your lab repo.
* A link to your deployed application.
* Any questions you would like answered by the instructor grading the lab.
